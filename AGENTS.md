# Agent Instructions

## Project management with Kanbus

Use Kanbus for task management.
Why: Kanbus task management is MANDATORY here; every task must live in Kanbus.
When: Create/update the Kanbus task before coding; close it only after the change lands.
How: See CONTRIBUTING_AGENT.md for the Kanbus workflow, hierarchy, status rules, priorities, command examples, and the mistakes to avoid. Never inspect project/ or issue JSON directly (including with cat or jq); use Kanbus commands only.
Performance: Prefer kbs (Rust) when available; kanbus (Python) is equivalent but slower.
Warning: Editing project/ directly violates The Way. Do not read or write anything in project/; work only through Kanbus.
Git / PR policy: Rules for product-code commits, branch names, pull requests, and human approval live in this repository's AGENTS.md (outside this Kanbus section). CONTRIBUTING_AGENT.md covers Kanbus board mechanics such as `kbs commit`; follow AGENTS.md for product code and git workflow.


## Product code, git, and BDD

- Stack: TypeScript throughout (CDK infra, Node Lambdas, Node runner, Vite/React web), plus a small C seccomp launcher. Python, C, and C++ are what the *student* writes, not what the platform is written in.
- Specifications are real Gherkin `.feature` files under `features/`, run with `npm test` (Cucumber.js). Write the scenario, watch it fail, then write the code. No red specs on `develop`.
- Branching is GitFlow: work on feature branches, merge into `develop` as soon as the specs are green, and let Semantic Release cut releases from `main`. Never push to `main` directly.
- Commits use Conventional Commits (enforced by commitlint via husky). Semantic Release derives versions and CHANGELOG.md from them.
